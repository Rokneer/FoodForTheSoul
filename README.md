# FoodForTheSoul

On his off day as a food photographer, Juan finds himself ravenously hungry and wishing for a bite to eat.
Lucky for him, just around the corner a colorful Colombian restaurant appeared. Just as he entered a cold sweat ran down his spine, this was no ordinary place.
Before he could escape his soul was trapped inside a cursed camera by the devilish head chef and now he must photograph ghostly food to serve to the ghoulish customers to free his soul.
